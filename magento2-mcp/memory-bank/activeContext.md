# Active Context: Magento 2 MCP Server

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on enhancing and refining the MCP server tools for fetching data about revenue and orders. This includes:

1. Improving error handling for the new tools
2. Adding comprehensive documentation for the new tools
3. Creating additional test cases for the new functionality
4. Optimizing performance for large result sets

## Recent Changes
- Implementation of the `get_order_count` tool to retrieve the number of orders for a given date range
- Implementation of the `get_revenue` tool to retrieve the total revenue for a given date range
- Implementation of the `get_revenue_by_country` tool to retrieve revenue filtered by country for a given date range
- Implementation of date parsing utilities to handle relative date expressions like "today", "last week", "YTD"
- Implementation of country normalization to handle both country codes and names
- Update of the test client to test the new tools
- Update of the Claude client to demonstrate the new tools

## Next Steps
1. Implement pagination handling for large result sets
2. Add caching mechanism for frequently requested data
3. Improve error handling for Magento 2 API rate limits
4. Add comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints and parameters
5. Create automated tests for the server functionality
6. Implement a logging system for debugging and monitoring

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Date Range Parsing
We need to implement a robust date parsing system that can handle various relative date expressions:
- "today" -> Current day
- "yesterday" -> Previous day
- "last week" -> Previous 7 days
- "this month" -> Current month
- "last month" -> Previous month
- "YTD" (Year to Date) -> January 1st of current year to current date

### Country Filtering
For the `get_revenue_by_country` tool, we need to:
- Determine how countries are represented in the Magento 2 API (country codes, full names, etc.)
- Handle case-insensitive matching for country names
- Support filtering by multiple countries

### Performance Optimization
For large date ranges or high-volume stores, we need to consider:
- Pagination of results
- Efficient filtering at the API level rather than client-side
- Potential caching of frequently requested data

### Error Handling
We need robust error handling for:
- Invalid date ranges (e.g., end date before start date)
- Unknown country names
- API errors from Magento 2
- Rate limiting or timeout issues

### Response Formatting
The response format should be:
- Consistent across all tools
- Easy for Claude to parse and present to users
- Include metadata about the query (date range, filters applied, etc.)
- Include summary statistics where appropriate
