# Progress: Magento 2 MCP Server

## What Works
- Basic MCP server setup with stdio transport
- Authentication with Magento 2 API using API tokens
- Product-related tools:
  - `get_product_by_sku`: Get detailed information about a product by its SKU
  - `search_products`: Search for products using Magento search criteria
  - `get_product_categories`: Get categories for a specific product by SKU
  - `get_related_products`: Get products related to a specific product by SKU
  - `get_product_stock`: Get stock information for a product by SKU
  - `get_product_attributes`: Get all attributes for a product by SKU
  - `get_product_by_id`: Get detailed information about a product by its ID
  - `advanced_product_search`: Search for products with advanced filtering options
  - `update_product_attribute`: Update a specific attribute of a product by SKU
- Customer-related tools:
  - `get_customer_ordered_products_by_email`: Get all ordered products for a customer by email address
- Test client for verifying server functionality

## What's Left to Build
- Enhanced error handling for the new tools
- Documentation for the new tools
- Additional test cases for the new functionality

## Current Status
- The basic MCP server infrastructure is in place and working
- Product-related tools are implemented and tested
- Customer-related tools are implemented
- Order and revenue related tools are implemented:
  - `get_order_count`: Get the number of orders for a given date range
  - `get_revenue`: Get the total revenue for a given date range
  - `get_revenue_by_country`: Get revenue filtered by country for a given date range
  - `get_product_sales`: Get statistics about the quantity of products sold in a given date range
- Date parsing utilities are implemented, supporting:
  - "today"
  - "yesterday"
  - "this week"
  - "last week"
  - "this month"
  - "last month"
  - "ytd" (Year to Date)
  - "last year"
  - Specific dates in ISO format
  - Date ranges in "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD" format
- Country filtering functionality is implemented, supporting:
  - Country codes (e.g., "US", "NL", "GB")
  - Country names (e.g., "United States", "The Netherlands", "United Kingdom")
  - Common variations (e.g., "USA", "Holland", "UK")

## Known Issues
- No comprehensive error handling for Magento 2 API rate limits
- No caching mechanism for frequently requested data
- No pagination handling for large result sets
- No authentication mechanism for the MCP server itself (relies on the security of the stdio transport)
- No logging system for debugging and monitoring
- No automated tests for the server functionality
- No documentation for the API endpoints and parameters

## Next Milestone
Enhance the existing tools with additional features and optimizations:
- Implement pagination handling for large result sets
- Add caching mechanism for frequently requested data
- Improve error handling for Magento 2 API rate limits
- Add comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints and parameters
- Create automated tests for the server functionality
- Implement a logging system for debugging and monitoring

This milestone will be considered complete when all these enhancements are implemented and tested.
